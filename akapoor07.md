Project: Recreation of Google Home

Google Home

Summary:
I am going to build a recreation of a google home device. A google home is a commonly known and used device which is able to check the weather, play the recent news, 
etc.Google Home can overall make many different tasks easier for users. I am excited to build this project because I think that it would be really cool to have a device 
similar to a google home in my house, especially when I put in the time and effort to build it myself. 

Plan:
The first step would include setting up the microphone because Raspberry Pi doesn't have an inbuilt microphone. The second step would be to set up the speaker and
run a test to ensure that both the microphone and speaker work. This concludes with setting up the needed hardware. The third step would include setting up the 
operating system and installing the Google Assistant SDK package, which will help run the Google Assistant on the Raspberry Pi. The fourth step includes creating a new 
project in Google Cloud Console. The fifth step would be to authenticate the Raspberry Pi.


Budget:
Products such as a MicroSD card, a mini microphone, a mini speaker, and a raspberry pi would all be necessary in order to build this project. I think that it would 
also be interesting to experiment with bluetooth connectivity which is why I would use both a bluetooth speaker and bluetooth headphones. All of the needed supplies 
can be found on Amazon at varying and reasonable prices.
